# TestableUnityFramework
Version 0.0.0
A Unity framework built to be more unit-testable (by removing as much logic as possible from MonoBehaviours and putting them in well-behaving, well-tested, generalized non-MonoBehaviour C# classes).

Can be included as a submodule and accessed within your project.

Still under construction, and totally unstable. Will be adding in-project tests, demos and documentation when I have time. I am developing this as a submodule inside a game project, so expect this to be updated as I need more features in the game.

Currently includes dependency injection, a resource library system, and an event system.

Documentation to come.
