# TestableUnityFramework
A Unity framework built to be more unit-testable (by removing as much logic as possible OUT of MonoBehaviours).

Can be included as a submodule and accessed within your project.

Still under construction, and totally unstable. Will be adding in-project tests, demos and documentation when I have time.

Currently includes dependency injection and an event system.
